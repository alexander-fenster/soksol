The input file for Sokoban solver.

The first two numbers define number of rows and columns in the field.
The field is defined in the following way:
- # for the wall
- . for the empty cell
- o for the destination cell
- x for the block
- X for the block in the destination cell
- s for the start position
- S for the start position in the destination cell

Everything after the field is ignored, hence this comment.
